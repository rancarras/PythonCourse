---Project description---

In my group we collect data that generates many files, and our current method for processing the data is to copy-paste each file's contents into origin, or some equivalent software. To speed up this process of copy-pasting I will write a code that takes the input from a directory and creates two files. One that stores the contents of all the files containing a specific string in their filenames, for example the polarization 'SPS'. And then one which stores all the contents, or data, of the files. The README file will contain instructions on how to make the code work.

The data also needs to be normalized. This will either be done in the same code, or separately. The reason for doing it separetly is that sometimes it is better to do baseline-correction before normalization.

If time permits the code will be made more user-friendly, potentially making it into a package.
